            <h1>You're Going to Hire Me.</h1>

            <p> Hello, my name is Jason Andrews I'm a student at Code Lousville.
                In about 24 weeks I will have the skills and knowledge to be 
                hired as a Junior Web Developer.</p>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        
        <div class="aboutme-content" style="flex-direction: row-reverse;">

        <div class="aboutme-content" style="flex: 1;">

        <div class="aboutme-content" id="aboutme-desc" style="border: ridge 3px #eef107; padding: 10px; background-color: #2fa1be;"> 
            <p> I am an up an coming Christian talent still developing my arsenal of skills. 
                I prefer to code remotely, but I am also open to in person placements.
                I am friendly, self-motivated, inventive, imaginative, resourceful, 
                flexible, and adaptable. I am also hungry to expand my present skill 
                set to add not only my adaptability, but also my flexibility. I thrive on 
                being better today than I was yesterday. Presently I am learning about
                front end development utilizing HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. I have attended Ivy Tech
                for software development, but decided to working wih Code Louisville to be a 
                more favorable option for my learning preferences. During my tenure I started 
                to learn HTML5, CSS and C++. I believe that if you learn from it, every mistake
                becomes a lesson, and if you teach it, you learn it's value. Hiring me is not a
                decison, it is an investment in the future of your company. I am sure there are other
                canidates that look better on paper now, but my future growth into cyber-security and 
                database administration will make me a secure long-term investment. You can keep day-trading
                short-term employees or invest in a future game-changer. I believe you deserve 
                the best, so I left my resume for you to have the option to make a good decision.
